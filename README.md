### A 2D Educational Game for Personal Hygiene Learning Using Image Processing

MY-HYGIENE is a 2D educational game designed to help young learners develop essential personal hygiene habits through fun, interactive gameplay.  
The game integrates **computer vision and image processing** techniques to encourage real physical interaction, bridging the gap between digital learning and real-life hygiene practices.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Teach children **handwashing**, **tooth brushing**, and **nail trimming** habits
- Increase engagement using **game-based learning**
- Reinforce hygiene behaviour through **real-time visual feedback**
- Motivate children with a **reward and sticker system**

---

## 🧩 Game Modules

### 👐 Handwashing
- Uses **MediaPipe Hand Landmark Detection**
- Tracks real hand movements via webcam
- Children must show both hands clearly to start
- Dirt is removed dynamically as hands move correctly

### 😁 Tooth Brushing
- Uses **MediaPipe Face Landmark Detection**
- Smile detection triggers gameplay
- Reinforces the association between clean teeth and a healthy smile

### ✂️ Nail Trimming
- Drag-and-drop mini-game
- Teaches precision and nail care awareness

---

## 🏆 Gamification Features

- Digital **Sticker Book**
- Reward badges for completed tasks
- Progress tracking (e.g. handwashing count)
- Encourages repetition and habit formation
